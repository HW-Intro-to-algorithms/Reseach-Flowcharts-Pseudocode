START
  Float A,b,c
  Float score=0

  For (i=1; i=<3;i++){

  Print ("enter your exam grades")
  Scan (a, b, c)

  Score= (a+b+c)/3

  Print (your score is score)
	  If (score<7){ 
		  Print (you did not pass)
		  Print (you will not receive a scholarship)}
		  Else{
			  Print (you passed)
			  If (score>9.5){print (you will receive a scholarship}
			  }
  }
